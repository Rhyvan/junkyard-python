#### TicTacToe Console Game
**Goal**: implementing it with the 3 paradigm: procedural, OO and functional way. Since TicTacToe was my first program with python, I was interested in how it would turn out with a different programming paradigm. Also great way to learn the key differences between them. 

(UI design and constraints are not main concern in this case.)

Status: 
 - [x] Object Oriented
 - [ ] Functional
